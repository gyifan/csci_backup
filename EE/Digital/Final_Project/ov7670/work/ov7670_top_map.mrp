  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

Section 1 - Errors

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Security:43 - No license file was found in the standard Xilinx license
directory.
WARNING:Security:44 - Since no license file was found,
WARNING:Security:42 - Your software subscription period has lapsed. Your current
version of Xilinx tools will continue to function, but you no longer qualify for
Xilinx software updates or new releases.
WARNING:Place:1399 - A clock IOB / BUFGCTRL clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGCTRL site pair. The clock
   IOB component <OV7670_PCLK> is placed at site <W10>. The corresponding
   BUFGCTRL component <OV7670_PCLK_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site
   <BUFGCTRL_X0Y0>. The clock IO can use the fast path between the IOB and the
   Clock Buffer if the IOB is placed on a Clock Capable IOB site that has
   dedicated fast path to BUFGCTRL sites in its half of the device (TOP or
   BOTTOM). You may want to analyze why this problem exists and correct it. This
   is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on
   COMP.PIN <OV7670_PCLK.PAD> allowing your design to continue. This constraint
   disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of
   this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing
   results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the
   design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2500 - This design does not have a PS7 block.
   Instantiate the PS7 block in order to ensure proper fabric tie-offs and
   correct operation of the processing_system7.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Security:51 - The XILINXD_LICENSE_FILE environment variable is not set.
INFO:Security:52 - The LM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable is set to
'2100@xilinx-license.bucknell.edu'.
INFO:Security:54 - 'xc7z020' is a WebPack part.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 0.950 Volts. (default - Range: 0.950 to
   1.050 Volts)

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
