Problem 1
1. I didn't observe any problem when my program runs.
2. Deadlock may occur based on my implementation. When all philosophors
   are angry at the same time and they all pick up the chopstick on 
   their left first, deadlock may happen.

Problem 2
1. As I placed napping(1) in between the philosopher picking up the 
   left chopstick and the right chopstick, when all of them are hungry
   simultaneously, they all hold left chopstick while waiting on the
   right one. Then, deadlock occurs.

Problem 3
1. Yes. These solutions breaks the symmetry and the circular wait. 
   Therefore, the modified function does not have required circular 
   relationship for deadlock. They eliminate all the potentials.
