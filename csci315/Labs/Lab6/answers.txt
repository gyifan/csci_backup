Problem 2
Semaphore: an integer value can range over an unrestrcited domain.
Mutex: an integer value can range only between 0 and 1 (aka binary semaphore).

pthread_mutex_init(): This function initializes mutex referenced by mutex with
	specified attributes.

pthread_mutex_lock(): This function tries to lock the mutex object referenced by
	mutex argument. If the mutex is already locked, the function will be
	blocked until the mutex is released.

pthread_mutex_unlock(): This function releases the mutex object referenced by 
	mutex object. After the release, the mutex will be available for other
	threads that are blocked by pthread_mutex_lock().

sem_init(): This function initializes the unnamed semaphore at the address 
	pointed to by sem argument with the initial value specified by value
	argument.

sem_wait(): This function decrements the semaphore pointed to by sem. If its
	value is greater than zero, then the decrement proceeds, and returns.
	Otherwise, the call blocks until the value is greater than zero, or 
	a signal handler interrupts the call.

sem_post(): This function increments the semaphore pointed to by sem. If it
	results the value becoming greater than zero, then another process or
	thread blocked in a sem_wait() call will be woken up and proceed to
	lock the semaphore.
