1. Segmentation fault is usually caused by the program trying to access 
   illegal addresses in the memory. 
2. Using doubly-linked lists can make it easier for the OS to move elements 
   from one list to another list. Also it keeps track of all the free and
   used blocks. However, depends on the algorithm we are using, we may need
   to sort through the list everytime when we have a new allocation.
3. Malloc will pick an element with enough space in free list and splits into 
   two elements. One of these element with needed space will be place to used
   list. We may also use arrays to keep track of the available and used
   spaces. But doubly-linked lists are more efficient and easier to operate.
4. Internal fragmentation occurs when we have separate the memory into fixed
   slices, the empty space in each used frame is called internal 
   fragmentation.
5. External fragmentation occurs when in the RAM as whole, there will some 
   space just can't fit in any process or won't be able to be used anymore.
6. First fit is allocating the first hole that is big enough for the request.
7. Best fit is allocating the smallest sized hole that can fit the request.
8. Worst fit is allocating the largest sized hole that can fit the request.
