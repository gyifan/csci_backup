Problem 1
 (1.1) cp is used to copy files and directories. 
       In this case, "cp -R ~cs315/Labs/Lab1 ." means copy all the files in
       ~cs315/Labs/Lab1 to the current directory. -R means all sub files and 
       folders. The period means the current directory.
 
 (1.2) doxygen is a documentation system that generate an on-line documentation
       browser (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference manual(in LATEX) from a 
       set of documented source files.
       In this case, we have two header files(dlist.h and dnode.h). All the 
       documented informations in these header files are displayed in the 
       index.html file.

 (1.3) GNU Make can be used to when compile multiple source files or component 
       divisions with specified dependencies between components. Also, during
       a recompiling process, make will only recompile the files which are
       changed. It can save a lot of time. Thus, make is an essential tool for
       a large software project.
       
       Each project needs a Makefile, a script that describes the project 
       structure, namesly, the source code fiels, the dependencies between 
       them, compiler arguments, and how to produce the target output.
