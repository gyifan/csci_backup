2) Not necessarily. Using malloc you can still get the addresses easily.
calloc() is just preferable because you know the size of each struct you want
to store, but not the number of threads until runtime. This makes dynamic
memory allocation easier. (-1).

2) This doesn't necessarily fix the problem. There can still be a context
switch after the printf() function that causes a delay between when printf()
happens and when pthread_exit() is called. 
Also, ctime() is not thread safe, meaning different threads can overwrite the
same buffer. ctime_r() helps fix this since it makes you specify your own
buffer.
