1. From the heap-test.c program, we obtain the following output.
     
     memory in heap Child: 10
     memory in heap Child new: 5
     memory in heap Parent: 10
   
   This output indicates that child inherit the a copy of its parent's
   heap. Also, this heap is unique and located at different memory location
   as its parent's copy. As we can see, the child can modify the heap. But
   the parent's copy didn't change.

2. Pipe is considered as an open file by the processors. After create the
   pipe, the parent add the pipe into the open file table. After calling
   fork, the child will inherit the open file table from its parent. Thus,
   as long as we can remember the file desciptor fro the pipe in and out, 
   the pipe can be accessed by the child.

3. The pipe is very similar to the Linux files when we use it. In both cases,
   we use write, read with the specific file descriptors to access them. 
   However, the difference is that the file descriptors for input and output
   are different in pipe implementation. On the other hand, Linux files has
   only one file descriptor for both input and output.
