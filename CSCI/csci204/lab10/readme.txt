The request delay is 21. There is no server rejecting request. Load is 30%.
variance is about 1.4. The load was 50% when server starts to reject requests.

Sample size 6 gives a good variance around 0.15. The line is almost flat.

By increasing the number of servers, the variance increased with the same 
sample size. But the total load decreased with the same request delay.
