Presented by: Yifan Ge, Kevin Thomas, Davis Gallinghouse

Guaranteed to run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
(run on other operating systems at your own risk).

Part 1: Getting Starting

1.  Launch Eclipse in Linux.
	(Applications -> Programming -> Eclipse)
	
2.  If MazeVizualizer.java is not already open, double click it from the package
	explorer on the left hand side.
	(MazeEscapingRobots -> src -> (default package) -> MazeVizualizer.java)

3.  To execute (run) the program file click the green play button on the toolbar
	or alternately hit Ctrl+F11 on your keyboard.

4.  At this point Java should have executed all the startup code and there
	should be a graphical user interface (GUI) on the screen from which the game
	will be played.
	
Part 2: Beginning the Game

1.  When looking at the top left of the GUI, you should notice two drop down
	labels.  The first is entitled "File."  Under here, you can either load a
	maze by choosing any of the numbered maze files (e.g. maze1.txt, maze2.txt
	etc.) or you have the option to quit the game.
	
	N.B. By loading the maze "random.txt", a new maze will be generated randomly
	every single time.  Try it out yourself!

2.  Now you should notice black and white lines in the center of the GUI to
	represent the maze, where black represents walls.
	
3.  Once you have a maze loaded, you will want to choose a robot to place in
	the maze.  To the right of "File" is a "Robot" drop down menu.  Here are
	the different robots you can choose to traverse the maze:
	
	Random Robot: will randomly choose from either turning left, turning right,
	or moving forward.
	
	Right Hand Robot: will always keep its right side against a wall. If it
	doesn't start against a wall, it will move forward till it gets to one.
	
	Memory Robot: will remember how many times it has stepped on every given
	square.  If it has the option to choose between two paths, it will choose
	the least stepped-on path.  Given two equal values, it will just choose
	the right path.
	
	Ninja Robot: will teleport forward 20 spaces, every time it moves ten
	additional spaces.
	
3. 	Click one, and it will be placed on the starting point of the maze.
	Notice the grey circle, with a line representing its current orientation.
    Now you are ready to begin playing the game!

Part 3: Playing the Game

1.  On the bottom right of the GUI you should notice four different buttons:

	Play: will cause the robot to continuously take steps.  This button will
	turn into a "Stop" button whenever it is pressed.
	
	End: will skip to the robot either escaping the maze, or the robot giving
	up after a given number of moves.
	
	Step: allows you to click through the game a single move at a time and
	see how the robot chooses its movement.
	
	Reset: places the robot back on the starting point and resets the move
	count.

2.  On the top right of the GUI you should see three data fields:

	Current Maze: displays the file name of the current maze text file.
	
	Robot: displays the name of the robot currently in the maze.
	
	Number of Moves: shows how many moves the robot has taken.
	
3.  Under the data fields is a check box labeled "Show visited halls?"
	This allows you to see how often the robot has stepped on a given square.
	The square will be white if it has never been stepped on and will get
	bluer the more often it gets stepped on.  If you want to enable this
	function you will need to hit the reset button after checking the box.
	
Part 4: Finishing the Game (assuming you are bored of the game)

1.  As mentioned in Part 2, under the "File" drop down menu, there is an option
	to quit.
	
2.  As an alternative, you can click the "X" at the very top-right of the GUI.
