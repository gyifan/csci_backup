The memory robot was the only part of this project that really made us think
about what our approach was going to be. We accepted the challenge, though, as
most of the project was already designed by the time by it got to us; the memory
robot was the only thing that really left us with a choice in implementation.
 
If you look at the table below, you'll see that not every robot is capable of
escaping every maze. Sometimes it is because mazes don't work well with the
algorithm the robot uses to try and escape, other times it is because the robot
is simply to stupid to escape anything beyond a small maze. The RightHand robot
tended to be the fastest, except in the one case where it didn't escape.
