Section 1: Opening The Game of Life in Eclipse
********************************************************************************

	1)Import GameOfLife project into Eclipse.
		First open Eclipse and select 'File->Import...'.  In the import window 
		expand the 'General' folder, select 'Existing Projects into Workspace' 
		and click the 'Next' button. In the next window click on 'Browse...' in
		the upper right corner and locate your copy of the 'GameOfLife' folder.
		Now click on 'Finish'.
		
	2)Select the project  
		Select the GameOfLife project in the Package explorer on the left side 
		of the screen. If you cannot see the Package explorer, in the top bar, 
		click on 'Window-> Show View-> Package Explorer'.
		
	3)Run the program
		To Run the GameOfLife, in the top bar, click on 'Run-> Run'. If asked 
		how to run the program, select 'Java Application' and continue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL FUNCTIONALITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	1)Making Cells alive/dead
		By clicking on any 'cell' on the board at ANY time will change the 
		current state of the clicked 'cell'.
		
	2)Selecting a game variant
		By using the drop-down menu above the previous button the user can 
		select a variant of the Game of Life. To select a variant, click the 
		arrow on the right side of the box and click on a version of the Game of
		Life that appears. See VARIANTS for further description of each option.
		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUTTON DESCRIPTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	1)Reset button
		The Reset button must be clicked to update any changes made to: Board 
		Size, Prob of Life, Max Generations. This button will also set the 
		Current Generation to zero.
		
	2)Play/Stop button
		Clicking on the Play button will begin the simulation.  This will 
		increment the Current Generation field for every time the board is 
		updated.  Once the play button is clicked it becomes the Stop button. 
		Clicking the Stop button will halt the simulation. 
		
	3)Next button
		The Next button allows the user to manually increment the Current 
		Generation of the simulation. This option is not available while the 
		board is in play mode.
		
	4)Previous button
		the Previous button allows the user to manually return the board to the 
		previous state. This option is not available in play mode.
	
	5)Print button
		The Print button displays a representation of the board using ASCII 
		characters in the Eclipse console. 'X's represent dead cells and 'O's 
		represent living cells.
		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DATA FIELDS	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	All the editable fields are updated upon Reset.
	
	1)Setting the Board Size
		The Board Size field is expecting a positive integer between 5 and 50. 
		This value represents the number of 'cells' per side of the board. This 
		value is updated upon clicking the Reset button.
		
	2)Setting Probability of Life
		The prob of life is expecting a positive decimal between zero and one 
		representing the chance that a particular cell will be alive upon 
		clicking the 'Reset' button. If probability of life is zero, upon 
		clicking reset all cells will be set to 'dead'. If the prob of life is 
		one then all cells will be initialized to alive.
		
	3)Setting Maximum Generations
		Maximum Generations represents the number of times the program will 
		update the board in the simulation. This value is updated upon clicking 
		the Reset Button.
	
	4)Current Generations
		This field indicates the number of times that the simulation has updated 
		the cells on the board.
		
	5) Birth Conditions
		When the 'Custom' game variant is selected this field allows the user to 
		enter specific conditions for a cell to be born. The expected entry 
		format is a list of integers separated by commas. Note that these 
		numbers represent the amount of neighbors for which a cell will be born.
		Example, if cells should be born if one, three, or five neighbors are 
		present then the following should be entered into the Birth Condition
		field: 1,3,5   Remember that the minimum number of neighbors is 0, and 
		max number of neighbors is 8. This field can be left blank to declare 
		that cells will never be born.
		
	6) Stay Conditions
		When the 'Custom' game variant is selected this field allows the user to 
		enter specific conditions for a cell to remain alive. The expected entry 
		format is a list of integers separated by commas. Note that these 
		numbers represent the amount of neighbors for which a cell will remain 
		alive.Example, if cells should remain if zero, two, or six neighbors are 
		present then the following should be entered into the Stay Condition
		field: 0,2,6   Remember that the minimum number of neighbors is zero, 
		and max number of neighbors is 8. The field can be left blank to declare
		that a cell will never stay alive after a round.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------		
GAME VARIANTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1)Custom
		This variant enables the Birth and Stay Condition fields, allowing the
		user to create custom game variants.(See Birth and Stay Condition fields
		description for more information.)  
	2)Conway's
		This variant follows the rule set where a cell is born if it has 3 
		neighbors and survives if it has 2 or 3 neighbors, any other number of
		neighbors results in a dead cell.
	3)Highlife
		This variant follows the rule set where a cell is born if it has 3 or 6
		neighbors and survives if it has 2 or 3 neighbors, any other number of 
		neighbors results in a dead cell.
	4)Seeds
		This variant follows the rule set where a cell is born if it has 2 
		neighbors and a cell will never stay alive since the stay alive field is
		blank for this variant.
	5)Day & Night
		This variant allows a cell to be born if 3,6,7, or 8 neighbors are 
		present. A cell will survive a round if 3,4,6,7, or 8 neighbors are 
		present.
			
	6)Replicator
		This variant allows a cell to be born if 1,3,5, or 7 neighbors are 
		present. A cell will survive a round if 1,3,5, or 7 neighbors are 
		present.
	
	7)Serviettes
		This variant allows a cell to be born if 2,3,4 neighbors are 
		present. A cell will never survive a round.
		
	8)Life No Death
		This variant allows a cell to be born if 3 neighbors are 
		present. A cell will survive a round if 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7, or 8 neighbors
		are present.
		
	9)Walled Cities
		This variant allows a cell to be born if 4,5,6,7, or 8 neighbors are 
		present. A cell will survive a round if 2,3,4, or 5 neighbors are 
		present.
		
	10)Diamoeba
		This variant allows a cell to be born if 3,5,6,7, or 8 neighbors are 
		present. A cell will survive a round if 5,6,7, or 8 neighbors are 
		present.
