   player (blue) and empty box for Announcements.
   
Playing the game:

   current move color and the current play's score increments. After that, the 
   current player changed to the other color.

2. By clicking on an occupied box, nothing changes, except the announcement box 
   displays "Occupied".
   
3. After adding the color A dot at one end, if it creates two A color dot 
   surrounds N color B dots in a straight line, all color B dot in between color
   A dots flip the color to color A. The color A score increases by N+1 and the 
   color B score decreases by N.
   
   A represents color A dot, B represents color B dot. Space represents empty
   box.

                   A        A
         B  -->   B  -->   A  (Score A + 3, Score B - 3)
        B        B        A
       A        A        A
       
   (All the numbers can be changed to any other integer within the limit)
   
4. The previous test has to happen simultaneously in all directions.

5. Only the newly added dot has the effect described in test 3. The flipped dots
   cannot initiate other flips.
   
6. The scores for each color have to be the same as the numbers of each
   corresponding colored dot on the board.

Ending the game:

1. After the board is full, the announcement box displays the winner.

2. By click on the reset button, the board will be cleared, the scores are
   zeroed, and the current move color is set to default color blue.
