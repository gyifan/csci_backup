================================================================================

Jar files is a short turn for Java Archive files. It aggregates many files into
one. Generally, .jar files are used to distribute java applications or
libraries. This allows Java runtimes to efficiently deploy a set of classes and
their associated resources. In short, .jar files are archive files that
contains information of many classes. By extracting .jar file to the project, 
we could extend the library and use the extracted classes just like using the
classes in Java library.

Advantages: users won't be able to change those classes that extracted from .jar
files, but they can use it by importing them. Information about these classes
can be provided through javadoc file.
