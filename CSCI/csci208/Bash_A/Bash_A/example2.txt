This is an excerpt from Lab 0.

File permissions can be seen by typing ``ls -al''.

\begin{verbatim}
drwx--x--x    2 cs208  cs           4096 Jan  2 10:27 .
drwx------    7 cs208  cs           4096 Dec 29 16:47 ..
-rw-rw-rw-    1 cs208    cs          47546 Oct  7 15:35 index.html
-rwxr-xr-x    1 cs208    cs         114473 Oct  9 12:46 runme
drwxr-x--x    2 cs208    cs           4096 Nov 25 19:28 solutions
\end{verbatim}

("ls -a" shows files beginning with ".")
The first letter in the file permissions shown by ``ls -al''is the 
file type (file, directory, or link). The rest of the letters are in 
sets of three for owner, group, and outsider permissions. Ony the owner 
of a file (and the system administrators) can change its permissions
In the example files shown above, the owner is ``cs208'' and the group 
is ``cs''. Some file permissions are shown below and are seperated into 
type, owner, group, and other.

\begin{verbatim}
type    owner/user   group   other/outsider   name
 -      rw-          rw-       rw-            index.html
\end{verbatim}

The index.html file is readable and writable by absolutely everybody. 
Nobody, including the owner, can execute it.

\begin{verbatim}
type    owner/user   group   other/outsider   name
-       rwx          r-x       r-x            runme
\end{verbatim}

The runme file is readable and executable by everybody but writable 
by only the owner.

\begin{verbatim}
type    owner/user   group   other/outsider   name
d       rwx          r-x       --x            solutions
\end{verbatim}

This file is a directory named solutions. Read, write and execute 
mean slightly different things for files and directories. Read 
permissions on a directory allow someone to use the ``ls'' command to 
see the directory contents. 

Write permissions allow someone to add files 
to the directory. Execute permissions allow someone to ``cd'' into that 
directory. If you have execute permissions but not read permissions, 
someone may ``cd'' into the directory but they may not ``ls'' to see 
the directory contents.

The first ``rwx'' set of the permissions for the solutions file means 
the owner can read the list of files in the directory, change *random change*
those files, and go into the directory using ``cd''. The second set of 
``r-x'' means that anyone in the same group can read the list of files 
in the directory and go into the directory using ``cd''. The third set 
of permissions, ``--x'' means outsiders can ``cd'' through the directory 
and through any sub-directories (if their permissions allow it) but 
cannot see a list of file names and cannot make any changes to the files.
