Problem 1.
The Object class implements the perform:with: method.

Problem 2.
As Float, Fraction, String, and etc. are all subclasses of Object. We should be able to generalize , operator by put it into the printing protocol of the Object class.

Problem 4c.
The ArrayedCollection class implements the size method. String is stored as an array of characters. The implementation of a String can be described in its parents or grandparents' classes. 
-3 as an integer will return 1. '-3' as a String will return 2. This is because length method is specified differently in the Integer and String classes.

Problem 4d.
This imply that all the subclasses will be able to call its super's length method to get the length of the Object. The methods in the superclassses are shared with their subclasses. Subclasses can also specify its own method with the same name.
