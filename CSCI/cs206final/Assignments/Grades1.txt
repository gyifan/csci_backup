3,5,6 are incorrect

didn't calculate CPI in 6

Although I gave you full credit for 1, 2, 3, average CPI should be calculated for each program using each compiler. A compiled program has different instructions with different CPI. So when you calculate the CPI for a compiled program, it is already an average.
4, 5, 6 are incorrect. they should be answered for each program with each processor.

4 is incorrect. MFLOPS = No. FP operations/(execution time * 10^6). Here the execution time refer to the execution time of all the FP operations, not the whole program.

2 is incorrect. It's asking how to reduce total time by 20% only cutting INT time.
5 for B is incorrect.

Total: 69/100
