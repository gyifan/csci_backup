Problem 1

1.1	address of the i-th element = base + sizeofnumber * (i-1)
		= 0x4567 + 8 * (i-1)

1.2	double* p = sample + 8 * 99;

Problem 2

2.1	address of the y coordinate of the i-th point 
		= address of points(base) + 4 + 8 * (i-1)

2.2	address of the x coordinate of the i-th point
		= address of points(base) + 8 * (i-1)

2.3	la	$s0, points	# load base address
	li	$t0, 8		# size of each point = 8 bytes
	li	$t1, 1		# i = 1
	li	$t2, 4		# coordinate (y)
	multu	$t0, $t1	# calculate offset
	mflo	$t3		# i offset 
	add	$t3, $t3, $t2	# address offest
	add	$t3, $t3, $s0	# address
	lw	$s1, 0($t3)	# load the value
	
	li	$t1, 2		# i = 2
	li	$t2, 0		# coordinate (x)
	multu	$t0, $t1	# calculate offset
	mflo	$t3		# i offset 
	add	$t3, $t3, $t2	# address offest
	add	$t3, $t3, $s0	# address
	sw	$s1, 0($t3)	# load the value

Problem 3

3.1	address of i-th frequency = directory + 12 + 16 * (i-1)

3.2	la	$s0, directory	# load base address
	li	$t0, 16		# size of each elemet
	li	$t1, 4		# i = 4
	multu	$t0, $t1	# calculate offset
	mflo	$t2		# i offset
	addi	$t2, $t2, 12	# address offset
	add	$t2, $s0, $t2	# address of directory[4].freq
	lw	$f0, 0($t2)	# load the value

3.3	By redeining struct radio_station to have an additional 	character, some of the addresses would become byte 		addressable, which will make it much more difficult for us 		to use base+offset to load the value. One solution would be 		adding a whole word (4 	characters).
