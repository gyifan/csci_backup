Problem1

(1.1)
Since I generate my solution for pre-lab3 by copying the base value of square array and adding 4 bytes for the next value, the answer is very same to the compiler generated answer. However, I do notice that the base value in the memory map didn't start on a whole number like 0x0000000000600000. However, the compiler declared a few more variables before the base value of square, such as __preinit_array_end,etc. 

(1.2)
The symbol T means this address is in the text(code) section

(1.3)
The symbol B means this address is in the uninitialized data section (known as BSS)
