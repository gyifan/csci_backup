Question 1:
In java, everything is passed by (value). Because Objects are actually references to heap memory, it appears as if they are passed by (reference).

Question 2:
(a)
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
void foo(int* x) {x=2;}

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int* z = &a;
    foo(z);
    cout << z << endl;
}

(b)
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
void foo(int* x) {x=2;}

int main() {
    int z = 5;
    foo(&z);
    cout << z << endl;
}

Question 3:
(a)

Question 5:
